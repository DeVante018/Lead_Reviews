Lead reviews is a movie/show reviewing web app! You can look up your favorite series and connect with fellow fans. Here is where you'll find the best TV shows and movies based on fan reactions and critical ratings!

Notes for grading

. Online users are displayed on the homepage (Users will not be logged out until they manually go to the settings page and log out)

. Direct message by clicking an online user.

. Uploading multimedia content is done on the settings page for the profile picture

. Logout is on the settings page

. The do not disturb option is by default set to off but can be changed per user on the settings page. This will stop notifications of incoming dm messages (this uses web sockets)
